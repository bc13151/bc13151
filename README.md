## Hello, here's a little bit about me.

My name is Brandon Cook, and I'm a student studying cybersecurity with a strong passion for computers. After participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) events durning high school,
I became interested in pursuing a career in cybersecurity. The intention of this page is to build a professional portfolio and outline projects I've been working on. I'm
very proud of my accomplishments, and I hope I can prove my skills to you.
